# Iris Flower Classification

This project involves building a machine learning model to classify the Iris flower species based on the famous Iris dataset. The dataset contains information about three different species of Iris flowers: *Iris setosa*, *Iris versicolor*, and *Iris virginica*. Each flower is described by four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.

## Project Overview

The objective of this project is to classify the species of an Iris flower based on its physical dimensions. This is a classic problem in machine learning and pattern recognition. Various machine learning algorithms can be applied to this dataset to build a classification model.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the Iris dataset, which is available in the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It consists of 150 samples, each with four features and one target label. 

- **Features**: 
  - Sepal Length
  - Sepal Width
  - Petal Length
  - Petal Width

- **Target Labels**: 
  - Iris Setosa
  - Iris Versicolor
  - Iris Virginica

The dataset is loaded using the `sklearn.datasets` library.

## Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sidd1018/irisflower.git
   ```

2. **Change directory**:
   ```bash
   cd iris-flower-classification
   ```

3. **Create a virtual environment** (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```



## Usage

To run the project, execute the following command in your terminal:

```bash
python irisflower.py
```

This script will train a machine learning model on the Iris dataset and display the classification results. You can modify the `irisflower.py` file to test different models or use different evaluation metrics.

## Model

In this project, several machine learning models can be used to classify the Iris flowers, such as:

- Logistic Regression
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest

Each model is evaluated using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Results

The results will include:

- Confusion Matrix
- Classification Report
- Model Accuracy

The model's performance will be displayed after running the script, showing how well it can predict the different species of Iris flowers.
